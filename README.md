# Vue Challenge Print.com
### Participant: Marijn Wijbenga

## THE ASSIGNMENT

Your task is simple, yet extensive: use Vue to create the most awesome selector ever. 
Make it pretty or make it functionally cool. Think about routing, state management, but most of all: WOW us!

Create a product selector that works for three different products from our catalogue (check out the JSON files). 
If something‚Äôs missing, feel free to surprise us! üòä

- Navigate via a menu to a product:  
    a. /product/posters  
    b. /products/flyers  
    c. /products/businesscards  
- Be able to view a product selector with available options.
- Be able to select different options within the product selector.
- Add products to the cart.
- Validate if the chosen options are possible with the excludes property 
  (properties within the excludes are not compatible with each other).


## TESTING & QUALITY
When you are working in our company, you will be working in a team which has to be able to read and test your code. 
Keep best practices in mind and make sure your code is clear to read. Bonus points if you have added (unit) tests!

### RULES
- Make the assignment with Vue3, Vite, and if possible, TypeScript.
- Don‚Äôt spend too much time on the assignment, 4 hours should be enough.
- Don‚Äôt worry if you cannot finish it all, quality > quantity.
- Share your code 24 hours prior to our meeting.
- During the meeting you‚Äôll be asked to show your code. We are curious about any ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù 
  you had to take and about the choices you made.
