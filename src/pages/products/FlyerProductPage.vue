        Ladies and gentlemen, this is HUUUGE! I’ve got something absolutely incredible to share with you today. Flyers.
        That’s right, folks, not just any flyers, but the greatest, most fantastic flyers you’ve ever seen. Believe me,
        nobody knows flyers better than me. I’ve seen a lot of flyers, and these? These are the best. The very best.
    </p>
    <p>
        These flyers are made with the finest materials. We’ve got the best paper – the strongest, the most luxurious
        paper. The kind of paper that makes you feel like a king just touching it. And the ink? Oh, the ink is
        incredible. Top-quality, vibrant colors. Colors so bright they’ll knock your socks off. I went to the best ink
        scientists, and they told me, “Mr. Trump, this ink is revolutionary.” And they were right! It’s tremendous.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, let me tell you about the designs. These designs are out of this world. We’ve got everything you can
        imagine – pictures of beautiful places, funny animals, inspirational quotes. We’ve even got pictures of food
        that look so real, you’ll want to take a bite. And the quotes – they’re the best. We’ve got quotes from the
        greatest minds in history, and of course, some from yours truly. You’ll feel smarter just reading them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s the deal, folks. It’s an unbelievable deal. Buy one flyer, and we’ll give you a second one for half the
        price. That’s right, half the price! It’s like getting one and a half flyers for the price of one. But wait,
        there’s more. If you buy three flyers, we’ll throw in a fourth one absolutely FREE. Free, folks! Who doesn’t
        love free things? Everybody loves free things. It’s a deal you can’t refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        And these flyers, they’re not just for handing out. You can use them for anything. Stick them on your walls, use
        them as bookmarks, make paper airplanes – the best paper airplanes, folks, guaranteed to fly farther than any
        other. You can even use them as placemats. They’re that good. And they’re waterproof! Yes, waterproof flyers.
        You can take them in the shower if you want. Incredible, right?
